Notes:
- The use of electric bikes by casuals may explain why they ride further than annual members.<br>
- The following graphs were made with Tableau at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/peter.thibodeau/viz/rideabletypeforcasualandmembers/Sheet2<br>
<br>
5. Casual riders prefer Saturday and Sunday over weekdays while annual members are a little more active Monday through Thursday

6. Both casuals and annual members utilize the bikes more in the warmer months, which is no surprise considering how cold the winters are in Chicago.

## Observations
- Maybe casuals ride longer because electric bikes make it easier?
- Maybe casuals like Sundays because they have the day off, but why Mondays?

## Recommendations
1.	Casuals may respond well to discounts for electric bikes.  
2.	Casuals may respond well to discounts on Sunday and Monday only.

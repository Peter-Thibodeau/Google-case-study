4. Casuals like electric bikes almost as much as conventional ones.

Note:
- The use of electric bikes by casuals may explain why they ride further than annual members.<br>
<br>
5. Casual riders prefer Saturday and Sunday over weekdays while annual members are a little more active Monday through Thursday

<br><br><br>
6. Both casuals and annual members utilize the bikes more in the warmer months, which is no surprise considering how cold the winters are in Chicago.

# Recommendations
<br>
1.	Casuals may respond well to discounts for electric bikes.  
<br>
2.	Casuals like long weekend rides and may respond well to a price structure that offers a discount for weekends without a discount for weekdays.
<br>
3.	Marketing to casuals should begin in the weeks leading up to spring and through mid October

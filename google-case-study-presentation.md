## Observations
- Casuals ride longer, possibly because electric bikes are easier to ride long distances with less effort.
- Casuals probably like Sundays because they have the day off. Meanwhile, the Mondays could be because their workplace is closed on that day, which is typical for restaurants, the Department of Motor Vehicles, etc...

## Recommendations
1.  Advertise/market to casuals on Friday and Saturday when they think about riding a bike on Sunday. Repeat on Monday to encourage use on other business days.
2.	Offer casuals electric-bike discounts for Sunday and Monday. Offer larger discounts for Tuesday through Saturday. 
3.	Offer casuals discounts on Sunday and Monday only.

Note: The use of electric bikes by casuals may explain why they ride further than annual members.

5.	Casual riders prefer Saturday and Sunday over weekdays while annual members are a little more active Monday through Thursday.
 


6.	Both casuals and annual members utilize the bikes more in the warmer months, which is no surprise considering how cold the winters are in Chicago.
 

Recommendations
1.	Casuals may respond well to discounts for the electric bikes.
2.	Casuals like long weekend rides and may respond well to a price structure that offers a discount for weekends without a discount for weekdays.
3.	Marketing to casuals should begin in the weeks leading up to spring and through mid October.
